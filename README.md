## Making The Base

![TheBase](images/TheBase.png)

I learned how to use patterns in Onshape. I also learned a lot of the basic stuff like how to extrude and make a sketch. There was some problems because I didn't get a mouse until yesterday evening, but it was resolved.

I learned how to revolve to create a part instead of having to extrude it.

## Making The WHeel

I used a circular pattern to create the spokes, which was pretty cool. I also used a revolve extrude, which i hadn't before. There were a lot of circles in this one, which was cool cas i like circles.
